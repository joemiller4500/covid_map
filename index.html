      <p>Thank you for visiting my COVID-19 Dashboard page! This project came about on the tail end of quarantining 
        after possible exposure to the virus, in a period of feeling anxious, fearful, and a bit useless in the face 
        of a threat that we still are trying to understand. I found that no matter where I looked, I would find 
        sensationalized reporting, whether I was being promised the light at the end of the tunnel, or an endless
        struggle, I felt like I couldn't make sense of the surges, the quarantines, the openings and the closures. 
        I found that the most informative sources tended to be the apps people had made from the data, because data 
        did not become politicized, it was not monetized, it's just data. I found at the same time that while I felt 
        that these purely data based sources were the best monitors of the spread of the virus I could find, they did
        not offer the same sort of nuance that I saw in print media. They would tell me how many people were getting 
        sick, but unlike in print, I didn't find why people were getting sick, or who those poeple were in the places 
        most affected by the virus. That's why I decided to make this dashboard.</p>
        <p>Two things I saw correlated to the virus 
        (and which are measured on the county level) were higher levels among members of minority groups, and greater
        spread in places were people didn't want to wear masks. Because there isn't concrete data at a county level for
        mask use, I used county level voting results from the 2016 presidential election. I realize the apparent
        shortcoming of this as a correlation to not wearing masks - it is a completely different statistic. Truly,
        without bias I cannot correlate presidential voting with mask wearing. I want to emphasize this point - voting
        for one candidate or another does not mean that someone had a certain predelection towards wearing or not wearing
        a mask. It is, however, the best source of data I had at the county level that could be correlated at all. I think
        it would be naeve to ignore that the wearing of a mask became politicized and that Donald Trump, for at least
        some time durring his presidency, was a champion of personal liberties in the face of the science behind masks.
        To that end, I make no conclusions about correlation with the spread of the virus, I simply encourage you to 
        click around and make your own conclusions.

        All COVID-19 data comes from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering 
        (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University and can be found <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">
        https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19</a>. All data on total population as well as racial/ethnic data comes 
        from the US Census Bureau, along with shapefiles for county lines. Election data comes from Stephen Pettigrew and 
        was published by the Harvard Dataverse.
